Their writing had hit a wall, and the lack of inspiration was to blame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That strikes me as an odd and hugely misleading way to think about inspiration, like it’s a resource that can run dry. Truthfully it never runs dry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying you’ve run out of inspiration is like saying you’ve run out of sights or sounds. You could become blind or deaf, but the sights and sounds are still present. There are visuals to look at and sounds to be heard, and they don’t run out – or at least they won’t run out during your lifetime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspiration is much the same. It’s always present. It’s a collection of signals that are always broadcasting – all the time and on multiple channels. Inspiration never switches off. This resource is always available to you. For all practical purposes, it is infinite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as you will never run out of sights to see or sounds to hear, you can never run out of inspiration. There is more inspiration available than you can possibly channel, even if you write, speak, or create 24/7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people can’t access inspiration, it’s like this scene from <em>The Three Stooges</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Larry: I can’t see! I can’t see!</p>\n<p>Moe: What’s the matter?</p>\n<p>Larry: I got my eyes closed!</p>\n<p>Moe pokes Larry in the eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can’t access inspiration, the inspiration itself isn’t the problem. Those signals are broadcasting loud and clear all the time. The problem is with your equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inspiration and Brain Health</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost always the problem is physical in nature. It’s a health issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You use your eyes and your brain to see light. If you can’t see anything when there is light hitting your eyes, that suggests a problem with your eyes or brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You use your ears and your brain to hear sounds. If you can’t hear anything when sounds are entering your ears, that suggests a problem with your ears or brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You use other parts of your brain to tune in to the flow of inspired thoughts and ideas. If you cannot perceive anything when you attempt to tune in, that suggests a problem with your brain. Something is preventing you from properly accessing this natural ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a problem with your eyes or ears, you can go to a doctor to get diagnosed and treated. If the doctor is competent and the condition treatable, you may be in luck. Unfortunately doctors cannot cure all cases of blindness or hearing loss, and in some cases they cannot even agree on a diagnosis of the cause. Nevertheless, they still typically consider the problem to be physical in nature. Even if the problem is labeled psychological, it’s still a physical problem with the brain instead of the eyes or ears. Some part of the brain is preventing the signals from being interpreted correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many writers love coffee, tea, and other stimulants. Why? These substances temporarily change the brain’s normal functioning, which can make it easier to tune in to the flow of inspired ideas. It’s like an eye poke to force your eyelids to open. Of course if you rely on this method too much, it can be like getting too many eye pokes, which probably isn’t good for your long-term eye health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as modern society can strain our eyesight and hearing, it can strain our inspiration circuitry even more. That flow of inspiration tends to be more sensitive to degradation when the brain is stressed, especially by poor diet, lack of exercise, and environmental toxins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t commonly hear laments about lacking inspiration from people who eat super clean diets, such as raw foodists. Hang out with such people for a while, and you’ll generally witness the opposite – an abundant flow of inspired ideas, available at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Treat the Causes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When there’s a lack of inspirational flow, don’t think of it as a psychological or motivational failing. Don’t think of it as a self-discipline problem. See it as a health warning that you should take seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing one’s ability to tune in to the flow of inspiration is the canary in the coal mine. It suggests that you’re heading down the wrong path health-wise. Your brain’s loss of ability signals danger. Treat this as seriously as if your eyesight or hearing starts to go. Your lifestyle is degrading your brain’s capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to reduce my sensitivity to the flow of inspired ideas, that’s relatively easy. I can just eat more processed food , fewer whole foods, and fewer fruits and veggies. If I want to increase my sensitivity, I can stick with whole foods and eat lots of fresh fruits and veggies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a short-term boost, one or two green smoothies a day is great. A 45-minute cardio workout is also great because it rebalances hormones and neurotransmitters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most powerful habits for a high-functioning brain, especially when it comes to tuning in to inspiration reliably, is daily cardio exercise. A good minimum is 45 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever run into writer’s block, try doing a one-hour cardio workout. Then drink a green smoothie (or sip on one while you write). Can’t do an hour-long cardio workout? That’s probably why you have writer’s block. If your body is that out of shape, so is your brain. Cardio doesn’t just exercise the body – it exercises and strengthens the brain too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our brains simply do not function well without regular exercise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may notice a difference in inspirational flow just from taking a day or two off from exercise. Take a week or more off from exercise, and the degradation of this natural ability will likely be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a really powerful long-term boost, eat 100% raw for a month or longer. The difference is undeniable. The cleaner your brain, the better it functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maintain Your Inspiration Interface</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your brain is your interface for tuning in to the flow of inspiration. If you don’t maintain that interface, it’s predictable that you’ll run into problems with degraded performance. And if you’re already running into problems, there’s your invitation to permanently upgrade your health habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your lifestyle involves feeding your body low-quality ingredients or disregarding your body’s need for regular exercise, creative blocks will serve to remind you that there’s a price to be paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brain degradation is often cumulative. The longer you maintain habits that degrade your mental functioning, the more trapped you may become. You still have to use that same brain to work your way out of that trap, so don’t bury yourself so deeply that you can’t climb back up again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspiration is a valuable personal resource. It’s a source of opportunity. It’s a way to connect with people. It’s readily convertible into other forms of abundance, including plenty of money if you so desire. But you need a properly functioning brain to intelligently leverage this resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best decisions you can make is to permanently raise your health standards, and decide to never go back to a degraded level of functioning. <a href=\"https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2015/05/how-to-be-vegan/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5361\">Going vegan</a> was a key turning point for me.

Food services added about 1.5 million.  \r\nLike reading a Rorschach test\r\nDon't take that unemployment rate at face value. May's 13.3% unemployment was artificially low because the Labor Dept. has been misclassifying some workers as employed. For June, that error (though smaller) could mean unemployment is closer to 12.1%.\r\nAnd there are other measures of the labor market that paint a different picture. Indeed Chief Economist Jed Kolko says \"core unemployment,\" which leaves out temporary layoffs, accelerated to 5.9% in June from 5% in May. That could indicate deeper economic pain than what appears in the BLS report. \r\nPlus, there's a timing issue\r\nUnlike your eighth grade science fair project, the Labor Department doesn’t throw these surveys together the night before. The June jobs report is based on data from the week of June 12...the week before we started writing about COVID-19 coming back with a fury.\r\nCases are rising in 40 U.S. states, and as businesses re-close or delay reopening, some workers are getting laid off or furloughed again.\r\nLong road ahead\r\nOverall, the June report is a positive sign. 7.3 million jobs added over two months puts a dent in the 20.5 million lost in April, but 19.3 million are still collecting unemployment benefits. SF Fed President Mary Daly said unemployment will probably stay over 10% for the remainder of 2020.\r\nBig picture: \"The pandemic pushed us into a very deep economic hole,\" Moody's Chief Economist Mark Zandi told the WaPo. \"We can certainly fall back.\"\r\nCurious what goes in an unemployment report?

Either beginner's luck or it's onto something, because shares jumped 139%, pushing the company to a market value of $3 billion.\r\n\r\nLike any good startup founder who just became insanely rich, Lemonade CEO Daniel Schreiber played it cool. \"We've got many years ahead of us...I'm not going to pay any attention to short-term fluctuations—even exciting ones like this morning,\" he told the FT. \r\n\r\nWhat's got investors so excited?\r\n\r\n\r\nInnovation: or lack thereof in the insurance industry. \"No one has really emerged at scale in this industry for a really long time—not since the 1950s,\" consultant Hugh Tallents told the FT. \r\n\r\nMillennials: In addition to a hot pink colorway, Lemonade has a business model it hopes will appeal to a younger demographic. It takes a fee on each policy it sells, then donates to charity any reserves not used for claims. \r\n\r\n+ More about Lemonade: If you want a deeper look into the insurtech industry, check out CEO Daniel Schreiber's interview on our podcast Business Casual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFireworks Go Direct-to-Consumer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. Air Force\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the fireworks industry, it is the best of times, it is the worst of times.\r\nStart with the bad: far fewer fireworks shows this July 4. Cities from Boston to SF have canceled big IRL celebrations because they know it'll draw a crowd, and crowd = not what you want to promote during a pandemic. \r\n\r\nFirework sales are hyper-seasonal—think of what canceling Halloween would do to the plastic pumpkin seed scooper industry. \r\nThat's currently happening to fireworks display companies. COVID-19 will wipe out more than 80% of their income, says the American Pyrotechnics Association (APA).\r\n\r\nBut people are still buying fireworks. It's just the folks who don't really know what they're doing. With major celebrations off the calendar, backyard consumer firework sales are expected to hit an all-time high, per the APA. And that's coming off a year when they already did $1 billion in revenue for the first time. \r\nLooking ahead...more backyard fireworks could lead to more injuries, so be safe out there and always discharge your fireworks from a hard, flat, and level surface. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPONSORED BY WITHIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s See Them E-Commerce Benchmarks \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s tougher than ever for brands to hit benchmarks.

Disney had planned to release Hamilton in theaters in 2021. But yada yada yada, the company decided to push up the launch date \"in light of the extraordinary challenges facing our world,\" per Executive Chairman Bob Iger.\r\nBottom line: Despite potential box office revenue going poof, Disney hopes the Hamilton buzz drives more subscriptions to its new Disney+ streaming platform, which costs $6.99/month. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIZ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Throwing Away My Quiz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, you think you read the Brew this week?

I actually think that’s higher than average!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if he does incredible work in those 2 hours a day, think of the good he could do if he doubled or even tripled that amount of focused time. His impact on the world would multiply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might be interesting to audit your own time, and see how much of it is focused, meaningful work. Is that a good amount for you, or would you like to increase your focused hours and impact on the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, what success I’ve had in increasing my focused time comes down to three habits:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Asking myself what meaningful, impactful work I can get done today.</li>\n<li>Creating space for the meaningful work instead of just doing busywork or being distracted all day.</li>\n<li>Working in fullscreen mode and diving in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at each of these habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deciding on Your Impactful Work</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us just dive into our inboxes, social media, favorite online sites, and busywork to start our day. We might have some bigger tasks on our lists, but they get lost in the woods of our day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an incredible habit to take even a few moments at the beginning of your day (or the end of the day before) to give some thought to where you’d like to concentrate your attention. What is worth doing today? What is worth focusing on? What is worth spending the limited time you have in this life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the answer is whatever meaningful, impactful work I might have on my plate. If I don’t have any, then it’s time to go to an even higher level view and ask what I want to focus on this year or this quarter. What good can I do in this world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, it’s fairly obvious — I know the bigger, more meaningful tasks I need to do. I make a list of 3-4 of them to try to accomplish for the day. Now I know how I’d like to spend my focused time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Creating Space for Focused Work</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Very often we’ll push off the bigger, more meaningful tasks because they take longer, and we’re either in distracted mode or quick-task mode. We don’t have time right now to do something that takes half an hour or more!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these impactful tasks get pushed back. The key habit here, then, is pausing to create space. Yes, I’m in quick-task, get-things-done-quickly mode. But I can shift gears. Set aside the next 20 minutes for writing, or getting moving on a big project. I don’t have to do the whole project in this time, but just the act of giving myself more space to focus is a huge shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is more of a mental act than a physical one: you just tell yourself that it’s time to focus on this important task. You breathe, and say, “This is worthy of my attention and effort right now. Let’s put aside everything else and give this some space.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a physical act as well: you might shut off your phone, turn off your internet, close all the other apps on your computer, clear your workspace a little to give yourself full space. Now you’re ready to focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Working in Focused, Fullscreen Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This habit is about letting this one meaningful task become your whole universe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us have worked in fullscreen mode in an app before — it takes your entire screen, and therefore your entire focus.

I actually think that’s higher than average!\n\n\n\nBut if he does incredible work in those 2 hours a day, think of the good he could do if he doubled or even tripled that amount of focused time. His impact on the world would multiply.\n\n\n\nIt might be interesting to audit your own time, and see how much of it is focused, meaningful work. Is that a good amount for you, or would you like to increase your focused hours and impact on the world?\n\n\n\nFor me, what success I’ve had in increasing my focused time comes down to three habits:\n\n\n\n\nAsking myself what meaningful, impactful work I can get done today.\nCreating space for the meaningful work instead of just doing busywork or being distracted all day.\nWorking in fullscreen mode and diving in.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at each of these habits.\n\n\n\nDeciding on Your Impactful Work\n\n\n\nMost of us just dive into our inboxes, social media, favorite online sites, and busywork to start our day. We might have some bigger tasks on our lists, but they get lost in the woods of our day.\n\n\n\nIt’s an incredible habit to take even a few moments at the beginning of your day (or the end of the day before) to give some thought to where you’d like to concentrate your attention. What is worth doing today? What is worth focusing on? What is worth spending the limited time you have in this life?\n\n\n\nFor me, the answer is whatever meaningful, impactful work I might have on my plate. If I don’t have any, then it’s time to go to an even higher level view and ask what I want to focus on this year or this quarter. What good can I do in this world?\n\n\n\nUsually, it’s fairly obvious — I know the bigger, more meaningful tasks I need to do. I make a list of 3-4 of them to try to accomplish for the day. Now I know how I’d like to spend my focused time.\n\n\n\nCreating Space for Focused Work\n\n\n\nVery often we’ll push off the bigger, more meaningful tasks because they take longer, and we’re either in distracted mode or quick-task mode. We don’t have time right now to do something that takes half an hour or more!\n\n\n\nSo these impactful tasks get pushed back. The key habit here, then, is pausing to create space. Yes, I’m in quick-task, get-things-done-quickly mode. But I can shift gears. Set aside the next 20 minutes for writing, or getting moving on a big project. I don’t have to do the whole project in this time, but just the act of giving myself more space to focus is a huge shift.\n\n\n\nThis is more of a mental act than a physical one: you just tell yourself that it’s time to focus on this important task. You breathe, and say, “This is worthy of my attention and effort right now. Let’s put aside everything else and give this some space.”\n\n\n\nIt’s a physical act as well: you might shut off your phone, turn off your internet, close all the other apps on your computer, clear your workspace a little to give yourself full space. Now you’re ready to focus.\n\n\n\nWorking in Focused, Fullscreen Mode\n\n\n\nThis habit is about letting this one meaningful task become your whole universe.\n\n\n\nMany of us have worked in fullscreen mode in an app before — it takes your entire screen, and therefore your entire focus. You aren’t distracted by notifications or switching between apps or browser tabs.\n\n\n\nTo be more focused, we should work in the same way — put ourselves in fullscreen mode. This one task is all that exists, and nothing else. There’s nothing to switch to. There are no distractions. Just this task. It’s the whole universe.\n\n\n\nFor me, this means writing in a fullscreen writing app. Or opening a browser tab in a separate window (with no other tabs showing) and putting that window in fullscreen mode. Or reading with an undistracted reading app like Instapaper.\n\n\n\nIt can also mean doing one thing at a time in offline life as well — washing a single dish while doing nothing else, or running with no music or podcast, just being present with the running. Brushing your teeth and really being there. Being fully present with whoever you’re talking with.\n\n\n\nIf something is worth creating space for in your life, it’s worth your full attention.\n\n\n\nWith these three habits, I believe we can all increase our focused time each day. It’s not about being perfect, and working in a focused way every single second of the day. It’s about not letting our attention always be distracted, and about giving ourselves the gift of meaningful work more often.","https://feedbin.me/entries/2125261297","2019-06-13T16:59:03.000Z","Trusting Yourself","https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2019/05/trusting-yourself/","Fri, 24 May 2019 03:34:29 +0000","<p>I recently made lists of my most personally meaningful accomplishments and experiences as well as my biggest regrets and mistakes of the past 25 years.
